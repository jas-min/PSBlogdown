<h1>Fleeing and Some Implications</h1>
<p>It’s never really surprising to hear about a police chase in where the suspect gets shot and then passes away. It’s not surprising when we hear of people fleeing from the police when the situation escalates. What is surprising to hear is when a law enforcement officer is prosecuted for the death of a fleeing sispect. In Georgia, a police officer had a fatal encounter with <a href="https://apnews.com/ae503a6672a34aff873260456224652f/Manslaughter-charge:-Georgia-officer-shot-fleeing-black-man">a man who was fleeing</a> was charged with manslaughter. A police officer was charged for the shooting and death of a <a href="https://apnews.com/f721e40873ef4b06ac2c5e6c0200d0f8/Officer-charged-in-death-of-black-teen-who-was-shot-in-back">teenager who fleed after a traffic stop</a>.</p>
<p>This analysis is going to explore some of the different circumstances behind fatal police shootings in where the victim was fleeing.</p>
