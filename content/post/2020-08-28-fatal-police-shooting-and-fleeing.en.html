<p>This analysis is going to explore some of the different circumstances behind fatal police shootings in where the victim was fleeing.</p>
<div id="type-of-fleeing" class="section level1">
<h1>Type of Fleeing</h1>
<p>Figure 1 below shows the proportion of those who do not flee, who do, and if they are fleeing, what method of fleeing that these individuals are using.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#proportion are killed while attempting to flee

Figure 1.
<em>The proportion of fatal police shootings by flee method over time.</em></p>
<p>Figure 1 depicts the proportion of fleeing by car decreasing and every other method is seen increasing, in recent. The proportion of the incidents where fleeing method is not recorded is increasing every year, almost to the same degree that the “Not Fleeing” method is decreasing, this should be taken into account.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>shootings %&gt;%
