&lt;h1&gt;Fleeing and Some Implications&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s never really surprising to hear about a police chase in where the suspect gets shot and then passes away. It’s not surprising when we hear of people fleeing from the police when the situation escalates. What is surprising to hear is when a law enforcement officer is prosecuted for the death of a fleeing sispect. In Georgia, a police officer had a fatal encounter with &lt;a href=&#34;https://apnews.com/ae503a6672a34aff873260456224652f/Manslaughter-charge:-Georgia-officer-shot-fleeing-black-man&#34;&gt;a man who was fleeing&lt;/a&gt; was charged with manslaughter. A police officer was charged for the shooting and death of a &lt;a href=&#34;https://apnews.com/f721e40873ef4b06ac2c5e6c0200d0f8/Officer-charged-in-death-of-black-teen-who-was-shot-in-back&#34;&gt;teenager who fleed after a traffic stop&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This analysis is going to explore some of the different circumstances behind fatal police shootings in where the victim was fleeing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;type-of-fleeing&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Type of Fleeing&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Figure 1 below shows the proportion of those who do not flee, who do, and if they are fleeing, what method of fleeing that these individuals are using.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;#proportion are killed while attempting to flee
shootings %&amp;gt;%
  mutate(count = 1) %&amp;gt;%
  aggregate(count ~ flee + year, data = ., sum) %&amp;gt;%
  group_by(year) %&amp;gt;%
  mutate(proportion = count / sum(count)) %&amp;gt;%
  ggplot() +
    geom_line(mapping = aes(x = year, y = proportion, color = flee)) +
    ggtitle(&amp;quot;Proportion of Fatal Police Shooting by Flee Method&amp;quot;) + 
    xlab(&amp;quot;Year&amp;quot;) + ylab(&amp;quot;Proportion&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
